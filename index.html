        Our restaurant room within the Délicatus pizzeria has a capacity of
         twenty-three seats as well as a covered terrace which itself can 
         accommodate eighteen guests. We invite you without hesitation to 
         reserve your table or even your takeaway pizza now.<br>
         With experience acquired during training in a pizza maker school,
         of great reputation, managed by a recognized master and several
         times titled. This allowed us to create an ancestral pizza dough 
         recipe using Italian flour, which gives it a light taste and texture.
         Handcrafted with fresh products from local producers, this makes 
         it an exceptional pizza.

    <div class="Preparation">
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn
             heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Preparation">
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of
             a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately 
             ½ inch from the edges.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Preparation">
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large
             pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over
             the top.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Preparation">
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone 
            or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the 
            cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.</p>
